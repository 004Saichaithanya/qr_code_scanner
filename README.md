## üìñ How It Works

- Uses **html5-qrcode** to access the device camera
- Defines a scanning area (`qrbox`) and scanning frame rate (`fps`)
- On successful QR code detection:
  - Displays the decoded text on the screen
  - Optionally stops scanning immediately after detection
- Clean, styled buttons to **Start** and **Stop** the scanner
